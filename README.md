# Analysis
Based on the findings, three-year range of birth years (1952-1955), there were more than 30,000 employees retiring in the near future. These retirees are mostly engineers. This means that there will be a high demand for engineers in the near future. However, the salaries earned by these older employees are quite low. They will have to raise the salary to meet market demands of new hire. As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, 7 different roles or titles will be impacted by this change. There are employees who can train and coach new employees coming on board. But the impact will be great over the next few years and each mentor will need to be coached and trained, either by senior management or through an outside consulting firm. This will also be financially burdensome. Mentoring is a good idea and in addition, PH should also consider keeping older employees on longer in a part-time role.
